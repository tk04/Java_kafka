# kafka-intro

Implementation of a kafka producer + consumer using kafka-clients java library

This repo contains a set of producers publishing messages to a topic called "first_topic", each with different configurations. 
Consumers read from that event stream, and are labeled in an consumer group. Different configurations and ways of reading of the topics are implemented in this repo.
